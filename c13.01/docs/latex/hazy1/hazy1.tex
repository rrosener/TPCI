{\em Cover image:
Two models of the molecular cores in Crab Nebula filaments are shown.
The upper panel is a scenario where shocks or other energy sources maintain
the temperature of the filament while the lower panel shows the case where
the synchrotron continuum energizes the filaments.
\htwo\ and CO emission lines are labeled in the lower panel. 
The red circles in the upper panel compares the  predicted shape of the dust thermal emission peak at 70 microns with the shape found from the Herschel observations by Gomez et al.
The
entire spectrum, including \htwo, CO, and dust emission, is computed self consistently 
by specifying only the composition, density, and column
density of the gas, and the SED and flux of ionizing photons and particles. 
Figure prepared by Jack Baldwin and is from 
\citet{Richardson.C12The-Nature-of-the-H2-Emitting-Gas-in-the-Crab-Nebula}.
