This directory contains the files needed to generate
an O3 optimized executable with g++

===========================

if you receive the error
#error "This g++ version cannot compile Cloudy and must not be used!"
it is because you have version 2.96 or 3.4 of g++.  These versions cannot
produce a valid executable.  Update to a more recent version of the compiler.
