 * Cloudy needs to read a large number of data files when it starts.
 * The location of these data on your system is specified by 
 *
 * #define CLOUDY_DATA_PATH "XXXX" 
 *
 * below, so the code is set up so that data will be automatically
 * located.  "XXXX" gives the locations of the data files on your computer.
 *
 * This can also be set by using an argument to the compiler.  That is
 * discussed on the web site at 
 * http://wiki.nublado.org/wiki/EditPath
 *
 * The data path can also be set by the CLOUDY_DATA_PATH environment
 * variable, but it is generally easier to provide the permanent
 * location at compile time by editing CLOUDY_DATA_PATH below.
