<h1>Read me file for the sample programs</h1>

<hr>
<p>These are a series of programs that show how Cloudy can be used as a 
subroutine of other, larger, programs.&nbsp; There are two ways to use these 
programs.&nbsp; You can 
create a library, compile the new main program, and link the main program to this library.&nbsp; 
Or you can compile the program and then link it to all of the object files 
created when Cloudy itself was compiled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Each sample program includes the header files cddefines.h and cddrive.h.&nbsp; 
These are included in the Cloudy source directory.&nbsp; You will need to 
alter these lines so that they point to where the files live on your machine or 
you will need to include the path to these files on your compile line.</p>
<p>The perl script <b><kbd>run_programs.pl</kbd></b> can be set up to use either 
gcc or the intel compiler.&nbsp; It reads a list of program directories from the 
file <b><kbd>run_programs.dat</kbd></b>, builds each by linking against the 
object files in source directory, and runs the programs.</p>
<p><a href="readme_template.htm">template.cpp</a>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is a template you can use to write your own program
that calls Cloudy as a subroutine.&nbsp; This provides a template C++ main 
program that includes the needed exception handlers.</p>
<p><a href="collion/readme_collion.htm">collion</a>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is an example of 
a gas in collisional ionization equilibrium.&nbsp; There is no ionizing 
radiation.&nbsp; This is something like the solar corona.</p>
<p><a href="comp4/readme_comp4.htm">comp4</a>, This checks that the code is properly initialized when it sets up.&nbsp; 
Two different models are computed twice and the output goes to file1.txt (the 
first pair) and file2.txt (the second).&nbsp; These files should be exactly the 
same.</p>
<p><a href="hazy_coolingcurve/readme_hazy_coolingcurve.htm">hazy_coolingcurve</a>&nbsp; This is an example of a 
gas in collisional 
ionization equilibrium in which the temperature is varied and the heating and 
cooling derived.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="hazy_kmt/readme_hazy_kmt.htm">hazy_kmt</a> - This redoes the 
&quot;S-curve&quot; calculation originally 
done by Krolick, McKee, &amp; Tarter
(1981; ApJ, 249, 422),&nbsp; </p>

thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p><a href="mpi/readme_mpi.htm">mpi</a>&nbsp; This is my main routine for running large grids on our HP cluster.&nbsp; It 
uses MPI to place a grid point on each processor.</p>
<p><a href="vary_nete/readme_vary_nete.htm">vary_nete </a>&nbsp;Both the electron 
density and temperature are varied over a broad range and several [O III] lines 
are predicted.&nbsp; This shows how to make diagnostic diagrams where line 
ratios are used to deduce temperature and density.</p>
<p><a href="varyn/readme_varyn.htm">varyn</a>&nbsp; This is a series of calculations in which the density is varied and the intensities 
of some [OII] lines relative to [OII] 3727 are printed.&nbsp; </p>
