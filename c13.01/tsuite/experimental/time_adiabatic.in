title adiabatically expanding cloud
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c 3 keV
blackbody 1.0e5 K
ionization parameter -10 time
coronal 1.0e5 K init time 
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
hden 1 linear
c thermal timescale is 9e10, this is much shorter so will
c approximate an adiabatic epansion
constant pressure time scale=1e8 power=-1
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
set dr 0 
set nend 1
stop zone 1
c
c other commands for details     =========
c the time dependent calculations will start on iteration 3
c first two are to relax the calculation
set dynamics relax 2
c number of time steps, should stop due to end of time, not this
iterate 60
c thermal timescale is 9e10 s so want this much sorter
time first timestep 7.0 end 10
time 8 scale 0    
time 9 scale=0  recombination
time 20 scale=0  
end of times
cosmic rays background
c
c commands controlling output    =========
print line faint 2 log 
print line cumulative
print ages

test time dependent adiabatic expansion
Cooling time is 9e10 s, this test occurs over 1e10 s so should
be nearly adiabatic
