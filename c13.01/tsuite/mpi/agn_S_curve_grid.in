title temperature across Spitzer thermal stability S curve
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c this is the generic AGN continuum
table agn
c the ionization parameter will be varied
ionization parameter 0.00 vary
grid from 0 to 3 in 0.2 dex steps
c add background so that FIR/radio does not have zero flux
background
iterate 
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
c intended to make sim run as fast as possible
hden 7 vary
grid from 7 to 9 in 1 dex steps
no level 2 lines
init file "ism.ini"
element sulphur off
element chlorine off
element argon off
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
stop zone 1
set dr 0
c
c commands controlling output
c this produces a very large number of lines in the output mostly
c because Hbeta is very weak in hot gas.  Choose Lya as the normalization
c line to make line list smaller
normalize to "totl" 1216
print line faint 10 will be varied
c create file with list of grid parameters
save grid "agn_S_curve_grid.grd" last
c save average H+ temperature
save average "agn_S_curve_grid.avr" last
temperature hydrogen 1 
end of temperatures 
save monitors "agn_S_curve_grid.asr"
c save heating and cooling
save heating "agn_S_curve_grid.het" last
save xspec atable "agn_S_curve_grid.atb"
save cooling "agn_S_curve_grid.col" last
save iron element "agn_S_curve_grid.fe" last separate
save brems opacity "agn_S_curve_grid.opc" last
save fits "agn_S_curve_grid.fit"

c commands giving the asserts    =========
//
monitor mpi

monitor hydro 2 temp grid "agn_S_curve_grid.dat" err 0.05

This computes a series of models that check the temperature
through the S curve in the Fields et al. three-phase model of
ISM stability.
