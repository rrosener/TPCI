c
c commands controlling continuum =========
cosmic ray rate -16
c this will be VERY faint black 50000
ionization parameter -25
black 50000 
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
hden 5
element hydrogen ionization 1 0.00000001
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
set dr 0 
stop zone 1
c
c other commands for details     =========
constant temperature 1000 K
c turn off molecules to test only ions 
no molecules 
c must turn off charge transfer and its heating, which would dominate,
c since we want to test cr heating and ionization
no charge transfer
no ctheat
c must turn of  photoionization by recombining species,
c since we want to test cr heating and ionization
no photoionization
c any time photoionization is turned off, it is best to also
c turn off induced processes, which include pumping in the lyman lines
no induced processes
