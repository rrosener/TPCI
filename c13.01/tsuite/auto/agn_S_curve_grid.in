title temperature across Spitzer thermal stability S curve
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c this is the generic AGN continuum
table agn
c the ionization parameter will be varied
ionization parameter 0.00 vary
grid from 0 to 3 in 0.25 dex steps
c add background so that FIR/radio does not have zero flux
background
iterate 
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
c intended to make sim run as fast as possible
hden 8
no level 2 lines // slight speed up - here for consistency with old ini file
init file "ism.ini"
element sulphur off
element chlorine off
element argon off
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
stop zone 1
set dr 0
c
c commands controlling output
c this produces a very large number of lines in the output mostly
c because Hbeta is very weak in hot gas.  Choose Lya as the normalization
c line to make line list smaller
normalize to "totl" 1216
print line faint 10 will be varied
c create file with list of grid parameters

This computes a series of models that check the temperature
through the S curve in the Fields et al. three-phase model of
ISM stability.
