This example tests whether induced processes force level populations
of hydrogen to LTE when they are irradiated by a
blackbody in strict thermodynamic equilibrium.  The density is
low enough value for radiation to dominate the rate equations
coupling levels with each other and the continuum.  The expectation
is for all departure coefficients to equal unity.

Checks:
-	Departure coefficients exactly unity.
-	Grain temperatures are exactly 5*104 K.
