c ========================================
c 

This is mainly a test of the ability of the code to converge a model
with a very strange electron density. The electrons are mainly contributed
by heavy elements, and the gas is only slightly ionized. 

Ionization of elements Fe, Mg, Si strongly affected by charge transfer
with other heavy elements.

Checks:
-	Electron density is correct.
-	Hydrogen line spectrum strongly pumped by continuum.
