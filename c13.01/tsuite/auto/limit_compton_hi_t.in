c commands controlling continuum =========
c as hot as STE bb can be on IEEE 32-bit cpu
c equilibrium temperature should also be 2.51e7
c since gas radiated by true blackbody will equilibriate
c at its temperature

c ========================================
c 

This is the highest Compton temperature that can be computed in
LTE on an IEEE 32-bit processor.  This tests the code in the
high-temperature Compton limit. Temperatures as high as 10^10 K
can be computed successfully on CPUs with longer word lengths,
such as a Cray or the new 64 bit processors. 

Checks:
-	The equilibrium temperature should be exactly 107.4 K (2.51239107 K).
