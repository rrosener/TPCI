c ========================================

This is a model similar in spirit to the blister geometry HII region
model computed by Baldwin et al. (1991). 
Size-resolved Orion grains are included.
The constant pressure command does a
hydrostatic equilibrium structure.  The predicted emission-line spectrum is
affected by the reddening of the internal grains.  The resulting t2
analysis produces artificial results as a result.
This has an open geometry, the original BFM paper was a closed geometry.
(This makes little difference).  Background cosmic rays are also included
although these should have little effect on warm ionized gas.  The emission
line spectrum is given in surface brightness units, as in the BFM paper.
