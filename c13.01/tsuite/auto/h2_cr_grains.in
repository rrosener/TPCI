c ========================================
c 

This tests conditions of cosmic ray ionization and grain formation pumping.
Solomon process is turned off with the "no induced processes" command
so cosmic rays are the main dissociation process.
This forms a pair with h2_cr which does not include grains, so relies
only on gas-phase chemistry.
