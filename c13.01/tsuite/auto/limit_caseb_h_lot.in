c
c commands controlling continuum =========
black body, T = 2.e5 K
ionization parameter -1
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
hden = 2
init file="honly.ini"
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
stop zone 1
set dr 0
c
c other commands for details     =========
constant temperature = 500
c want H and he fully stripped so we can check H He spectra
case b hummer no photoionization no pdest
no induced processes (OK) 
iterate
c
c commands controlling output    =========
normalize to "Ca B" 4861
c
c does not agree with Hummer & Storey, as explained by Ferguson & Ferland
c until 03 jun 02, used small atom, which had smaller differences
c turn on large atom to get best answer
atom h-like levels resolved 20

This tests the ionization and emission line spectrum for 
H case B at a low density and temperature.
