This test irradiates a set of grains with a true blackbody in
strict thermodynamic equilibrium.  We expect the grains
(and everything else) to equilibriate at the blackbody temperature.
The gas temperature is forced to the radiation temperature because
the current molecule network (based on ISM approximations) does not
go to LTE in the high-radiation density limit.  The calculation
asserts that all grain temperatures are very close to the radiation
temperature.
