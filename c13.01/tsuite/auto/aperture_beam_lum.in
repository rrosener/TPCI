This is a homogeneous sphere that is especially simple.  The model
is a test of the aperture command, a command that simulates observing
part of an extended object.  In this case the aperture is a beam
contered on the center of the nebula, with a line of sight
extending through the object.  

The code carries along a dummy emission line ("Unit 1") with a constant intensity
of 1e-10 erg cm-3 s-1.  The line goes through all of the code's infrastructure,
and when the calculation is complete, the program confirms that the "luminosity"
of the line is the emitting volume times 1e-10.  The aperture command
is verified by asserting that this emission line has the correct "luminosity".
