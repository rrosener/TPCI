this tests the predicted He II spectra in the Case B limit.

this effectively turns off hydrogen to avoid the problem with every
other heII line lying beneath an HI line.  this is done by reducing
the number of levels for H I.

this asserts the values are within 9% for the standard T = 1e4K and
a range of densities.  Actually they are all nearly within a few
percent except at the lowest temperature of 5000K.
