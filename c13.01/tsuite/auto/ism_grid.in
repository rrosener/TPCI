c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c this uses the Black continuum with no H-ionizing radiation,
c and with background cosmic rays

c
c commands for density & abundances =========
hden 0 vary
grid from -3 to 2 in 0.5 dex steps
init file="ism.ini"
c this turns on ism abundances and grains
abundances ism

c commands controlling geometry  =========
c set sphere since matter in all directions
sphere 
stop temperature linear 10
stop thickness 0.1 linear parsecs
stop zone 1 
c
c other commands for details     =========
c this prevents continuum pumping from exciting H0
case b
c
c commands controlling output    =========
c this model has no heavy element molecules, because H2 does not
c really fully form, since Lyman bands are not self-shielded

c ========================================

this shows an S-curve calculation - make plot showing density as X-axis
and gas pressure (nT) as y-axis

the gas is ionized by the galactic background.  the density varies between
1e-3 and 100 cm-3.  this is the full range found in the diffuse ism.
The components that are produced are 
CNM - cold neutral medium, density ~ 40 cm-3
WNM - n ~ 0.5 cm-3, 
WIM - warm ionized medium, n ~ 0.25 cm-3
HIM - hot ionized medium, n ~ 1e-3 cm-3, calculation DOES NOT 
      reproduce observed temperature of HIM - we get ~1e4K but
      observed is ~1e6 K.  HIM is shock, not photo, ionized
