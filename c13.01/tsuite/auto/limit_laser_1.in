This checks the calculation of the hydrogen photoionization equilibrium.
The continuum is a laser peaked at 1.5 Ryd, where the hydrogen
photoionization cross section is 2.09*10-18 cm-2. 

Checks:
-	The hydrogen neutral fraction is nearly 2.00*10-4 (not exact
	since laser has finite width).
-	Hb emissivity close to high density case A.  The predicted
	TOTL 4861 intensity should be nearly 2.2 times the expected
	case B intensity.

H cross section is 2.09E-18 cm^2, rec coef is 4.18E-14
answer is neutral fraction 2.00E-4
also checks that only 3 iterations needed
