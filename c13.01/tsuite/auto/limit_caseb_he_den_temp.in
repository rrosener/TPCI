this tests the predicted He II spectra in the Case B limit.

this effectively turns off hydrogen to avoid the problem with every
other heII line lying beneath an HI line.  this is done by reducing
the number of levels for H I.

this asserts the values are within 15% for a range of density and temperature.
Actually they are all nearly within a few percent except at the lowest
temperature.  The error greater than 10% occurs at the lowest temperature
of 5000K.
