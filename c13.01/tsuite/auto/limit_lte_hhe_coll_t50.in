This model is a test of the behavior of hydrogen and helium
in the high density, collision dominated, limit.
The temperature is preset, the hydrogen density is set
to a very high value, and the ionization parameter is very low.
The resulting model is collision dominated, so this case
checks that the collision physics occurs in detailed balance.
The predicted departure coefficients should all equal unity.
The set dr command sets the zone thickness to 1 cm.  

Checks:
-	Hydrogen departure coefficients exactly unity.
-	Helium departure coefficients near unity.  
	(Density not high enough to bring helium departure coefficients
	exactly to unity.)
-	H-, H2, H2+ H3+, and HeH+ departure coefficients exactly unity.
