This model has a very high iron abundance, 100x H, and most Fe is
in the form of Fe+. It is irradiated by a blackbody in strict
thermodynamic equilibrium.  We check that the temperature
of the gas is equal to the radiation temperature, to confirm
that the thermal properties of the model FeII atom obey thermodynamics.
