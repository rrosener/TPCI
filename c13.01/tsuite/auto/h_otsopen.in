c other commands for details     =========
c must iterate to get inward line fractions, that are asserted below
iterate 
diffuse ots
c not iterating does not affect the solution
no level2
no induced processes (OK)

c commands giving the monitors    =========
c this is an open geometry, so do not expect H atom to exactly be case B
c due to Lyman line leakage.  we iterated, so have a good estimate of
c inward and outward fractions, which we test

c ========================================
c 

This tests the total emission from a hydrogen Stromgren sphere
using the OTS approximation.  The conservation of the total number
of ionizing photons, and the emitted spectrum, are all checked.
