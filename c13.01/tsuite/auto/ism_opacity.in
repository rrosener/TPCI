c ========================================

This example creates the file ism_opacity.opc which tabulates
the total opacity of the gas as a function of energy.  These
plots are used in ISM studies to understand the transmission
characteristics along a line of sight.  The opacity depends on 
the dust to gas ratio, the gas phase abundances, and the level
of ionization, all of which can be changed by altering parameters
given above.

The model is of a 1 cm think parcel of gas which is optically thin 
in the Lyman continuum and Lyman lines.  As a result the hydrogen
emission line spectrum is close to case C.  The model iterates
so that the predicted ionization and emission know about this.
