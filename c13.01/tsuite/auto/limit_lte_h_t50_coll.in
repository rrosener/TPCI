This checks that the model H atom goes to LTE at high densities. 

chng 06 aug 24, had not included collisional ionization, and so he-like
departure coefficients were very large, around 202.  comments said there
were problems.  turned on collisional ionization, no problems noted

chng 06 jul 22
with RP changes in high-n n-changing collisions the rates are now much
smaller - needed to change density to be far higher and several 
quantities changed.  at lower density (1e18 cm-3) the populations are very
unphysical and runaway maser now occurs.  this is only a homework problem
and intended to only test n-changing collisions.  with higher density
this test is done.
