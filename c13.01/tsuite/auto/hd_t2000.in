title test large H2 molecule in shock-like conditions
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c there is a continuum but it is unimportant
c first continuum is FIR hot grain continuum produced in 
c unmodeled HII Region
black 30000
intensity  -5 range  0.4412 to 1 Ryd
c this will remove all ionizing radiation
extinguish 24 0
c must provide source of ionization for chemistry 
cosmic rays, background
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
hden 6
grains ism, abundance log 0.16 single
init file="ism.ini"
abundances he -1.01 c -3.52 n-8 o-3.30 ne-8 mg-5.89
continue si -6.10 s -5.10 cl=-7 ar-8 fe -6.60
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
stop zone 10
c force zone thickess to 1 cm 
set dr 0 
c need to lower stop temperature since gas is cooler than 4000K
stop temperature 3
c
c other commands for details     =========
failures 2 
set isotopes all
atom hd  
constant temperature 2000 
iterate
c this stop Lymnan line excitation of H, which is then photoionized
c by Balmer continuum
case b

c ========================================

This is a collisionally dominated HD simulation.  The temperature
has been fixed at 2000K and the large molecule turned on.
