This simulation tests the SET DRMIN command. It is a toy model of a planetary
nebula that is designed to extend into the PDR. The minimum stepsize is
deliberately set much too large so that we would immediately notice if the
command was broken. It also tests if we still hit the correct outer radius
when SET DRMIN is used. Without the SET DRMIN command this sim would need
410 zones (trunk@2760).
