This is one of the "warm absorber" simulations presented at the Lexington
2000 meeting on nebulae.  Pequignot et al. summarized in 2001ASPC..247..533P.
It is necessary to also include the command
no induced processes
to obtain the results presented there.  This disables UTA ionization,
a process that was not included in the calculations presented in the paper.
