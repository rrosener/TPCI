This tests the grains in an extreme condition - irradiation by an AGN
near the illuminated face of the molecular torus.  The gas is 
predominantly heated by the grains. The grain treatment has been
reverted to Weingartner & Draine, 2001, which is NOT appropriate
for these conditions. It is however a good test whether the old
treatment is not broken....
