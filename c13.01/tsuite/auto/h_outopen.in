c commands giving the monitors    =========
c this is an open geometry, so do not expect H atom to exactly be case B
c due to Lyman line leakage.  we iterated, so have a good estimate of
c inward and outward fractions, which we test 
monitor line "Q(H)" 4861 > 1. error 0.02 %>1 due to lyman line leaking
monitor line "H  1" 4861 = 1 error 0.02 %no surprise if not unity, since open

c ========================================

This tests the total emission from an open geometry, 
hydrogen Stromgren sphere,
using the outward only approximation.  The conservation of the total number
of ionizing photons, and the emitted spectrum, are all checked.
