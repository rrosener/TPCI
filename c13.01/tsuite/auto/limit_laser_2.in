This checks the calculation of the hydrogen and helium photoionization
equilibrium. The continuum is a laser peaked at 2.0 Ryd, and so can
only ionize hydrogen and atomic helium. 

Checks:
-	The hydrogen neutral fraction is nearly Ho/H+=4.51*10-4
	(not exact since laser has finite width).
-	Hb emissivity close to high density case A.  The predicted TOTL 4861
	intensity should be nearly 2.2 times the expected case B intensity.
-	Helium ionization should be Heo/He+ = 6.61*10-4.

H cross section is 0.927E-18 cm^2, rec coef is 4.18E-13
answer is Ho/H+ = 4.51e-4
HeI cross section is 6.54E-18 cm^2, rec coef is 4.32E-13
answer is Heo/He+ = 6.61e-5
