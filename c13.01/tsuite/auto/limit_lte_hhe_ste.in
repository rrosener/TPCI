c ========================================
c 

This is the ultimate test of the behavior of the code in the
strict thermodynamic equilibrium limit. The temperature is not
held constant, so the resulting equilibrium temperature determines
whether cooling processes are treated properly in the detailed balance limit.
The equilibrium temperature should be exactly 5*104 K, and all
departure coefficients should equal unity. A small amount of
grains are included to check that the grain thermal balance is
handled properly in this limit. 

Checks:
-	Electron temperature exactly 5*104 K.
-	Departure coefficients unity.
