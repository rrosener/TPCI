This tests the behavior of the code in the Compton limit.
The incident continuum is a blackbody in strict thermodynamic equilibrium.
Strict thermodynamic equilibrium is expected for all constituents of the gas.
The input stream also lists the expected photon fluxes for the incident
continuum; this tests the normalization of the continuum,
and its distribution. Grains are included to confirm their behavior
in the LTE limit. The set dr command sets the zone thickness to 1 cm. 

Checks:
-	Luminosity, photon flux, over various energy intervals, 4*J at 912143.
-	Electron temperature exactly 2*105 K.
-	Grain temperature forced to 2*105 K by radiative processes.
