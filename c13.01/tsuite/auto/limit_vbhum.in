This is a test of the treatment of the diffuse fields, their transfer,
and their effects on the ionization structure of a nebula. The comparison
is made against the exact calculation published by Van Blerkom and
Hummer (1967). The geometry is open, that is, similar to that assumed
in most BLR calculations. 

>>refer	H	ionization	Van Blerkom, D., & Hummer, D. G. 1967, MNRAS, 137, 353

The diffuse ots command is entered in order to reproduce the
Van Blerkom and Hummer results.  The default assumption, outward only,
does not agree as well.  I changed the default from OTS to outward only
to be in better agreement with predictions by Harrington and Rubin
at the Lexington meeting.  They have not checked whether their codes
are in agreement with the Van Blerkom and Hummer paper.

Checks:
-	Neutral fraction at illuminated face 5.8*10-4.
-	Location of ionization front at 7.8*1016 cm.
-	34TOTL 486134 and 34CA B 486134 agree;  both slightly lower than 34Q(H) 486134.
-	Answers with OTS agree with 1967 results.

test hydrogen ground state rec effic against vb+h exact results
this is their case e) - "zero condition"
their answer for H0/Htot at the illuminated edge is approx 5.8E-4,
and a Stromgren radius of approximately 7.7E16 cm
