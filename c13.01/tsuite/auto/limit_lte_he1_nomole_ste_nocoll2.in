test whether a gas dominated by He goes to LTE in a range of conditions.
The level populations should be in LTE, the departure coefficients
should be unity, and the temperature equal to the BB temp.

Level collapse options have been switched off in this, compared
to limit_lte_he1_nomole_ste, so effect of including the collapsed
levels on LTE can be verified.
