Installation
===============================

After ensuring that all of the above pre-requisites are working and
installed the user can download  pyPLUTO-|version|.zip from `here`_.

The code can be installed using a standard procedure. This can be done by following steps:

1. **Global Install**

The Python version from the EPD version by default creates a PYTHONPATH. If no option is chosen for preferred path
then in that case the code will be installed in that default path.  This may require the user to have access to the root password:

 - Unzip/Untar the source code : ``unzip pyPLUTO-|version|.zip`` or  ``tar  -xvzf pyPLUTO-|version|.tar.gz``
 - Enter into the directory : ``cd pyPLUTO-|version|``
 - Install the code in the default path : ``python setup.py install``

2. **Local Install (Recommended)**

The best practice is to create your own PYTHONPATH and do a local install in the following way:

 - Create a directory where to store this module : ``mkdir MyPython_Modules``
 - Unzip/Untar the source code : ``unzip pyPLUTO-|version|.zip``  or  ``tar  -xvzf pyPLUTO-|version|.tar.gz``
 - Enter into the directory : ``cd pyPLUTO-|version|``
 - Install the code in the directory created : ``python setup.py install --prefix=<path to MyPython_Modules>``
 - Then append the following in your .bashrc : ``export PYTHONPATH =<path to MyPython_Modules>/lib/python<ver>/site-packages``

where <ver> is the python version which the user have used to install the package.


3. **GIT Repository**

This code is also available as a git repo and can be obtained as
follows : ``git clone git://github.com/coolastro/pyPLUTO.git``


After the successful installation, the user can start using GUI application by appending the <path to GUI_pyPLUTO.py> into their PATH.
